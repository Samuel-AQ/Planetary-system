# Planetary system using Processing
## Description
This is an applicaton that emulates an imaginary planetary system using 3D shapes provided by Processing.
## How it works
In order to use the application you just have to run the main file. It will show you the system I coded and the visualization controls you can use, which are:
* Mouse wheel to adjust the zoom
* Arrow keys to rotate the whole system
* Press 'L' to show or hide the legend
## Implementation decisions
This application has been developed according to the principles of Jakob Nielsen. It's easy to use, makes the user feels the control at every moment and uses a minimalist and simple design. It is not possible for the user to generate any programming error so it hasn't been necessary to control the user's movements. The controls are shown at every moment so it's not possible for the user to get lost using the application.
